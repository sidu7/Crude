This function builds a 2D line segment's data using 2 points
 - Computes the normal (Unit Vector)
 - Computes the dot product of the normal with one of the points

 - Parameters
	- LS:		The to-be-built line segment
	- Point0:	One point on the line
	- Point1:	Another point on the line

 - Returns 1 if the line equation was built successfully
